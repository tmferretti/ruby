    return "There must be something in the water
And there must be something about your daughter
She said our love ain't nothing but a monster
Our love ain't nothing but a monster
With two heads

I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with two heads and one heartbeat
I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with two heads and one heartbeat
We just got caught up in the moment
Why don't you call me in the morning instead
Before we turn into a monster
Before we turn into a monster with two heads
I hope to god I'll love you harder
I hope to god I'll love you longer
If only I could live forever
If only I could hold you longer

There must be something in the water
And there must be something about your daughter
She said our love ain't nothing but a monster
Our love ain't nothing but a monster
With two heads

I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with two heads and one heartbeat
I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with two heads and one heartbeat
We just got caught up in the moment
Why don't you call me in the morning instead
Before we turn into a monster
Before we turn into a monster with two heads

I hope to god I'll love you harder
I hope to god I'll love you longer
If only I could live forever
If only I could hold you longer
Well I hope to god I'll love you harder
I hope to god I'll love you longer
If only I could live forever
If only I could hold you longer"
